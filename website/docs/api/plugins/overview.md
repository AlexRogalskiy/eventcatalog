We provide official EventCatalog plugins.


## Generator plugins {#generator-plugins}

EventCatalog allows you to generate documentation/schemas and much more using it's Plugin API.

### Generator Plugins

These plugins can be used to generate documentation from third party solutions.

- [@eventcatalog/plugin-doc-generator-asyncapi](plugins/@eventcatalog/plugin-doc-generator-asyncapi)

:::warning
The Plugin API is currently experimental and will change soon in future releases.

We will have clear API and docs on how to contribute your own Plugins and Utility functions you can use using EventCatalog packages.

You will be able to generate documentation from any third party tool you want...

**This is the focus on the next release.**
