### Logos & Favicons

When you initialise your EventCatalog folder you will have a `public` directory.

You can replace the `logo.svg` and `favicon.ico` files here. The changes will then be shown on your Catalog.

### Title & Description

You can change your Catalogs title and description, you can find more details in the [eventcatalog.config.js API](/docs/api/eventcatalog-config#title)

### Footer Links

Every page in EventCatalog has a footer which you can customise. 

To change the links head over to the `eventcatalog.config.js` file and change the [footerLinks](/docs/api/eventcatalog-config#footer-links)

If you don't want any footer links, just remove them from the `eventcatalog.config.js` file.
